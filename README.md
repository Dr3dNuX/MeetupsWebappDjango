# MeetupsWebappDjango
A meetups webapp built using the django framework and sqlite database

This was a an amazing course teaching all the basics of python Django framework from the youtuber academind. 

I learned a lot during this course, learned how to start a project and add / segregate apps, wire-up your apps to the main project, use views and URLs, use the include function to pass the urls of your apps, pass objects to views and use interpolation to display those objects, dynamic data gathering and generation, use models to model your database, use forms to build website data entry points for your web app, using render function to render templates, the Django template language, use ifs elses and loops in template language, use Django {{ load static }} to let Django dynamically load in static files and build links, use includes to break up HTML code snippets into reusable parts, change and modify the admin panel built into Django, register your models in the admin panel, and much much more.
